### JMeter Performance Testing

[JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) is an open-source tool designed for load testing and measuring the performance of various services, 
with a focus on web applications. It can simulate multiple users with concurrent threads, generate a heavy load against web servers,
and analyze the overall service performance under different types of load.

**Creating Custom Tests:**  
For guidance on creating your own JMeter tests, consult the [JMeter User Guide](jmeter-guide.md).

**Running Tests:**  
To execute the tests, simply run `mvn verify`.

**Viewing Test Results:**  
Results are generated in the `target` directory and can be viewed in real-time in the console output if running tests from the command line.
